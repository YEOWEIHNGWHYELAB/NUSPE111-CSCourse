NAME
     compress, uncompress, zcat - compress and expand data

SYNOPSIS
     compress [ -f ] [ -v ] [ -c ] [ -V ] [ -b _b_i_t_s ] [ _n_a_m_e ... ]
     uncompress [ -f ] [ -v ] [ -c ] [ -V ] [ _n_a_m_e ... ]
     zcat [ -V ] [ _n_a_m_e ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     _C_o_m_p_r_e_s_s reduces the size of the named files using adaptive
     Lempel-Ziv coding.  Whenever possible, each file is replaced
     by one with the extension .Z, while keeping the same owner-
     ship modes, access and modification times.  If no files are
     specified, the standard input is compressed to the standard
     output.  Compressed files can be restored to their original
     form using _u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s or _z_c_a_t.

     The -f option will force compression of _n_a_m_e. This is useful
     for compressing an entire directory, even if some of the
     files do not actually shrink.  If -f is not given and
     _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s is run in the foreground, the user is prompted as
     to whether an existing file should be overwritten.

     The -c option makes _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s/_u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s write to the stan-
     dard output; no files are changed.  The nondestructive
     behavior of _z_c_a_t is identical to that of _u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s -c.

     _C_o_m_p_r_e_s_s uses the modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm popularized
     in "A Technique for High Performance Data Compression",
     Terry A. Welch, _I_E_E_E _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r, vol. 17, no. 6 (June 1984),
     pp. 8-19.  Common substrings in the file are first replaced
     by 9-bit codes 257 and up.  When code 512 is reached, the
     algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and continues to use more
     bits until the limit specified by the -b flag is reached
     (default 16).  _B_i_t_s must be between 9 and 16.  The default
     can be changed in the source to allow _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s to be run on
     a smaller machine.

     After the _b_i_t_s limit is attained, _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s periodically
     checks the compression ratio.  If it is increasing, _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s
     continues to use the existing code dictionary.  However, if
     the compression ratio decreases, _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s discards the table
     of substrings and rebuilds it from scratch.  This allows the
     algorithm to adapt to the next "block" of the file.

     Note that the -b flag is omitted for _u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s, since the
     _b_i_t_s parameter specified during compression is encoded
     within the output, along with a magic number to ensure that
     neither decompression of random data nor recompression of
     compressed data is attempted.

     The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of
     the input, the number of _b_i_t_s per code, and the distribution
     of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code
     or English is reduced by 50-60%.  Compression is generally
     much better than that achieved by Huffman coding (as used in
     _p_a_c_k), or adaptive Huffman coding (_c_o_m_p_a_c_t), and takes less
     time to compute.

     Under the -v option, a message is printed yielding the per-
     centage of reduction for each file compressed.

     If the -V option is specified, the current version and com-
     pile options are printed on stderr.

     Exit status is normally 0; if the last file is larger after
     (attempted) compression, the status is 2; if an error
     occurs, exit status is 1.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Usage: compress [-dfvcV] [-b maxbits] [file ...]
             Invalid options were specified on the command line.
     Missing maxbits
             Maxbits must follow -b.
     _f_i_l_e: not in compressed format
             The file specified to _u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s has not been
             compressed.
     _f_i_l_e: compressed with _x_x bits, can only handle _y_y bits
             _F_i_l_e was compressed by a program that could deal
             with more _b_i_t_s than the compress code on this
             machine.  Recompress the file with smaller _b_i_t_s.
     _f_i_l_e: already has .Z suffix -- no change
             The file is assumed to be already compressed.
             Rename the file and try again.
     _f_i_l_e: filename too long to tack on .Z
             The file cannot be compressed because its name is
             longer than 12 characters.  Rename and try again.
             This message does not occur on BSD systems.
     _f_i_l_e already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
             Respond "y" if you want the output file to be
             replaced; "n" if not.
     uncompress: corrupt input
             A SIGSEGV violation was detected which usually means
             that the input file has been corrupted.
     Compression: _x_x._x_x%
             Percentage of the input saved by compression.
             (Relevant only for -v.)
     -- not a regular file: unchanged
             When the input file is not a regular file, (e.g. a
             directory), it is left unaltered.

     -- has _x_x other links: unchanged
             The input file has links; it is left unchanged.  See
             _l_n(1) for more information.
     -- file unchanged
             No savings is achieved by compression.  The input
             remains virgin.

BUGS
     Although compressed files are compatible between machines
     with large memory, -b12 should be used for file transfer to
     architectures with a small process data space (64KB or less,
     as exhibited by the DEC PDP series, the Intel 80286, etc.)
