4/91	Jeff Reilly - Start of log.

	Experimental version (smaller, multi-pass, realistic compression)
	made official, but still has stripped-down Makefile.

8/8/91  David Neff
	All known bugs fixed, specifically:
	o Now using Jack/Pasad's quieter Makefile/Makefile.debug setup.  Thus,
	  o No longer creates unnecessary 30Mb file.
	  o Follows mount/umount conventions, for better or worse.
	  o compress/uncompress run with explicit path for root.
	o Default changed to ENMNT = NONE
	o result.{short,ref}/result.out now exists (empty).
	o Obsolete files deleted (both from experiment and from earlier
	  version).
	o Since input/result file is so much shorter (1Mb for ref), compare
	  entire file instead of head, tail, CRC.
